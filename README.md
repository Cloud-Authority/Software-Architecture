# Software-Architecture Assignments

## 1) E-Learning Platform Design Document:
### Description: 
Develop a software design document for an e-learning platform that delivers online courses, quizzes, and interactive learning materials.
### Requirements: 
The design document should outline the platform's architecture, user roles (e.g., students, instructors, administrators), course management features, content delivery mechanisms, assessment tools, and collaboration features (e.g., discussion forums, messaging).
### Additional Details: 
Include wireframes or mockups illustrating the user interface for course enrollment, lesson navigation, content consumption, and assessment submission. Discuss how the platform supports multimedia content (e.g., videos, presentations), asynchronous learning, and real-time interactions among learners and instructors.

## 2) Restaurant Ordering System Sequence Diagram:
### Description: 
Create a UML sequence diagram depicting the interactions between a customer, a waiter/waitress, and a restaurant's ordering system during a meal order.
### Requirements:
The sequence diagram should illustrate the steps involved in browsing the menu, placing an order, notifying the kitchen staff, preparing the meal, serving the food, and processing the payment.

## 3) Movie Ticket Booking System Sequence Diagram:
### Description: 
Design a UML sequence diagram to model the interactions between a user, a movie ticket booking website/application, and a ticketing system for booking movie tickets online.
### Requirements:

## 4) Component Diagram for Inventory Management System

## 5) Student Registration System Data Flow Diagram:
### Description: 
Design a UML data flow diagram for a student registration system that shows the flow of information between students, administrators, and the registration system's components.
### Requirements:
The data flow diagram should include processes such as "Student Registration," "Course Enrollment," "Grade Submission," and "Report Generation," along with data stores such as "Student Database" and "Course Catalog."
### Additional Details: 
Define data flows representing student information, course details, enrollment requests, and academic records exchanged within the system. Discuss how the data flow diagram helps visualize the registration process and identify interactions between users and system components.
